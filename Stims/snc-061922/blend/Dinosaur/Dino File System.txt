File System:
s -> "sss"
xs -> "shh"
F -> female voice
M -> male voice
dinosaur.stereo -> both voices
e.g., m.sh -> gender.sound
e.g., m.sh_f.s -> m.sh = L ear; f.s = R ear 
	(Did not make counterbalanced example stims yet)
R -> removed s from appropriate talker
No.dB -> did not change dB of male voice 
	(Working on balancing M vs F)
