Talkers:
----------
Simulated a female, prosocial talker with a sh bias.
Simulated a male, neutral (antisocial?) talker with an s bias.
----------
F/M.X -> Gender of VoI
X.L/R -> Ear presentation of VoI

Xsh -> ambiguous sh (F)         + unambiguous s (M) for comparison
Xs -> ambiguous s (M)           + unambiguous sh (F) for comparison
FW -> catch tiral (prosocial/neutral prime)

XX_abc.xyz -> word spoken by VoI . word spoken by other talker

*VoI = Voice of Interest

I tried to create a small systematic matching mix, simulating a female talker with an "sh" bias and a prosocial catch word, and a male talker with an "s" bias and a neutral catch word. 

I matched the F.Xsh with M.S, M.Xs with F.Sh, F.Fw with M.Sh, and M.Fw with F.S, and also tried to balance which ear the talker is in. 

I may have gotten this jumbled, but I'm fairly confident matching...
F.Xsh + M.S = Sh bias in F; 
M.Xs + F.Sh = S bias in M; 
F.Fw + M.Sh = baseline Sh in M (contrast with new M.S); 
M.Fw + F.S = baseline S in F (contrast with new F.Sh)
