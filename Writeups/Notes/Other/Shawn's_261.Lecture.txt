spectral mean --> average acoustic energy; s has less/is higher spectral center of gravity, she has more/is lower spectral center of gravity

Lack of invariance problem --> the s/sh spectral mean average overlap a lot

Make a graph of the shift in the production of s/sh for both talkers

luthra et al., 2021  exp.4 --> only showing one (shifted) category

Average across the entire S-shaped curve to see the difference



Causal Ambiguity --> Why the atypical sound was produced (pen or not)

Kraljic et al., 2008: atypical + pen --> normal = no adpatation
Kraljic & Samuel, 2011: normal + pen --> atpical = learning

If the variation seems characteristic or is incidental (caused) = ignored (Kraljic, Brennan, & Samuel, 2008)

Kraljic & Samuel, 2011 --> instead, episodic memory with pen is stored as a separate episode than those without the pen. Episodes are groupd and then retrieved differently.

Lui & Jaeger 2018 --> store casually ambigous information

Uncertainty maintenance --> how long do we remember ambiguous information (that of the pen)

What obstructions result in an equivalence class --> how do instances get lumped together (does utility and heightened attention increase the specificity of classes --> tends to in perception of details; contrast)
