495,Condition.54_M_L_A_Sh_01_B_0_1,Not really honestly. It felt a bit robotic but recording single words can sound like that.,
451,Condition.47_M_L_A_S_05_B_1_0,I did not notice anything interesting in how he spoke. He sounds normal to me but probably a computer-generated voice.,
445,Condition.61_M_L_A_Sh_05_B_0_0,Nothing odd,
455,Condition.49_M_L_A_Sh_01_A_0_0,"I was concentrating on the words being spoken, not the speaker's inflections in part 1.",

546,Condition.15_F_L_A_S_05_B_1_0,"I noticed towards the end that it was more than probable many of the words the speaker was saying had some kind of purposeful lisp or speech impediment while saying certain words which may have meant I was saying certain ""sounds"" were words but that actually weren't. ",
544,Condition.58_M_L_A_Sh_05_A_0_1,No it was easy to tell whether the word was real or made up,
501,Condition.8_F_L_A_S_01_B_1_1,No,
531,Condition.41_M_L_A_S_05_A_0_0,"I didn't notice anything odd about the speaker. The voices switched from side to side every few words, and sometimes it seemed the male voice grew quieter when it switched, but that could be just my hearing difference between ears.",

509,Condition.12_F_L_A_S_05_A_1_1,I did not notice anything specific about the talker that spoke except it sounded like more than one speaker,
446,Condition.20_F_L_A_Sh_01_A_1_1,"I'm aware that in these types of experiments, one or both of the speakers in the exposure phase produces an ambiguous sound between /s/ and /sh/. I didn't actually consciously notice anything though because I was distracted by the two voices and the task was difficult.  ",

452,Condition.52_M_L_A_Sh_01_A_1_1,"The only thing that felt odd to me as that there were times when his syllables were not strong enough for me detect if he just said a real words. The female voice had more clarity. Not that his was bad. It just wasn't as clear to hear his pronunciation as hers. I guess that's part of the test, in a way.",
511,Condition.33_M_L_A_S_01_A_0_0,"It was much easier to determine the word the talker said when the word started with a consonant. Outside of that, there was nothing out of the ordinary.",

453,Condition.10_F_L_A_S_05_A_0_1,The talker attempted to slow down the words as the test progressed.,
494,Condition.18_F_L_A_Sh_01_A_0_1,"The voice changed, it was a female but the actual person changed so the words sounded different.",
550,Condition.36_M_L_A_S_01_A_1_1,The male talker had a somewhat feminine voice.,
