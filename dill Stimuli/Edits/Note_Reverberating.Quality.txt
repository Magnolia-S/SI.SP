A quality I can best describe as a reverberating robotic-esque sound in male manipulation (seems to be related to dropping the pitch median specifically) sounds to me like it causes the two voices to merge when they are combined to create the stereo file. I mostly hear the female voice and can't seem to willingly change this the more the male voice has that quality when listened to in isolation.
